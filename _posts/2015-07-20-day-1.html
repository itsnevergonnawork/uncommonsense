    <h3>2pm FIND YOUR TRUE VOICE – VOCAL WORKSHOP</h3>
    <p>Find your tru voice and keep it raw. Through vocal exercises with movement – sounds like a good workout when she describes it – Serbian-Greek vocalist Dunja Boltic will take us on a journey towards developing our true voices. Everyone has one – If you haven't found yours, standing on one leg and waving your arms while making sounds is likely to be a step towards it. Singers often learn to perfect a voice they invent/imitate and don't develop their actual voice. On one leg they are likely to, apparently.  'Singing is like talking, just another language,' Dunia says. 'It's there, in everything', it's about observation and experimentation. This is lesson one.come</p>
